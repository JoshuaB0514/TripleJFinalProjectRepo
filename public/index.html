            <h2>Welcome to Pizza Crafters!</h2>
            <p>Here at Pizza Crafters, the sky is the limit! Regular chains play it too safe? Here you can order whatever you'd like, as long as we are able to make it for you with the selection of ingredients we have on hand! Want to see a pizza made that has the sauce dribbled over the cheese? Go for it! Want a pizza that has TRIPLE the amount of cheese advised? We can do that for you! Like our name suggests, we'll help you craft whatever pizza you want, down to the details!</p>

            For the events I plan on including the 3 basic columns seen here (Event Number acting as a handy ID!), as well as some additional information that is stored in mongodb and then shared through a click of the button for that row, for this first push, that remains broken for now as I am building out these html files first
        -->

            <h2>Events</h2>
